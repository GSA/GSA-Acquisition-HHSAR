         <p class="p List1">(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-4b, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations, contracts and orders involving human subjects.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-6, Restriction on Use of Human Subjects, in contracts and orders if the contractor has an approved FWA of compliance in place, but cannot certify prior to award that an IRB registered with OHRP reviewed and approved the research, because definite plans for involvement of human subjects are not set forth in the proposal (e.g., projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds). Under these conditions, the contracting officer may make the award without the requisite certification, as long as the contracting officer includes appropriate conditions in the contract or order.
